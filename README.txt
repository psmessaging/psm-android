psm-android does NOT have a standard open source license and is limited to non-commercial use.

Please read the LICENSE.txt for more information...


DESCRIPTION:

The psm-android projects is the android client that connects to the psm-server.  It is a functioning client for Facebook and FourSquare and allows stealth messages/locations/photos to be placed on users social network wall or checkins.  It also allows for private SMS messages.


PURPOSE:

If you have a Social Network client application, this allows for a private stealth message, that only users of the psmessaging service can see.  This psm-server allows you to implement the process in your application, but is limited to non-commercial use.  You very well might end up creating a side by side social network, that slowly moves users from one social network to another through this psmessaging service.  There are many possible uses for this, but the intended use is to allow private messaging across a social network that is built into a 3rd party social network client.


COMMERCIAL USE:
PSM-SERVER AND IT'S FORKS ARE NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE.


LICENSING:

There is a STRICT license for private use and/or commercial use.  Please read the LICENSE.txt for full details, but psm-server is NOT open source.  This is the code to allow you to integrate it with your small scale applications to evaluate it before using it for commercial use, which is not free.
